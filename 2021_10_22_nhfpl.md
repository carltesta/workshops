## Playing Sounds (samples)

`sound "drum"` plays one drum per cycle\
`sound "drum drum"` plays two drums per cycles (sounds twice as fast)\
`sound "drum*2"` shorter way to write the above code\
`s "drum ~"` s is a shortcut for sound and tilde (~) denotes a rest\
`s "drum [sd cp]"` the brackets create a subdivision in the cycle\
`s "drum [sd, cp]"` if you put a comma in between the sounds happen at the same time
`s "drum*3" # n "0 1 2"` using the n function allows you to choose different samples from the same bank
`s "drum*4" # n (irand 6)` use the irand function to choose random samples from that sound bank

Let's create combinations of patterns using different samples. Try some of the following `bass drum bd sd lt mt ht hh ho hc print can bottle`

Try it!

## Writing pitches!

`slow 2 $ note "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12" # s "gtr"` use the note pattern to assign numbers to pitch values, `slow 2` stretches the pattern over 2 cycles\
`slow 2 $ note (scale "major" "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7") # s "gtr"` use the scale function to constain the numbers to the notes of a scale\
`slow 8 $ note (scale "major" "2 1 0 1 2 2 2 ~ 1 1 1 ~ 2 4 4 ~ 2 1 0 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 0 ~ ~ ~") # s "blip"` write melodies!\
`slow 4 $ iter 8 $ note (scale "major" "2 1 0 1 2 2 2 ~ 1 1 1 ~ 2 4 4 ~ 2 1 0 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 0 ~ ~ ~") # s "blip"` create variations with functions

## Visual Sources

osc(freq,sync,offset)\
noise(scale,offset)\
voronoi(scale,speed,blending)\
shape(numsides,radius,smoothing)\
gradient(speed)

 ## Blending

add(color,amount)\
diff(color)\
layer(color)\
blend(color,amount)\
mult(color,amount)

`osc(10,0.1,1.5).layer(noise(1.5,1.4).out()`

Try it!

Take what we've learned and create a audiovisual composition together, folks can take turns with the visuals Hydra.
